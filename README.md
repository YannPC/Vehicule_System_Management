# Vehicule_System_Management

Project: Vehicle Management System
1. Define Requirements
• Manage different types of vehicles (Car, Truck, Motorcycle).
• Store vehicle details and perform operations (add, display, parse input, etc.).
---
2. Step-by-Step Tasks
Task 1: Create Enums and Structs

• Enum: Define VehicleType (Car, Truck, Motorcycle).
• Struct: Define RegistrationInfo (registration number, date).
Task 2: Create Base Class and Derived Classes
• Base Class: Vehicle (encapsulation: private fields, public properties).
• Derived Classes: Car, Truck, Motorcycle (inheritance).
Task 3: Implement Polymorphism
• Create a virtual method in Vehicle (e.g., DisplayInfo()).
• Override in each derived class.
Task 4: Handle Null Values
• Allow some properties to be nullable (e.g., owner name).
Task 5: Use Functions
• Create methods for adding vehicles, displaying all vehicles, parsing input.
Task 6: Use Try-Catch, Parse, TryParse
• When parsing user input (e.g., registration number, vehicle type), use try-
catch and TryParse.
Task 7: Application Logic
• Console menu for user actions (add, display, exit).
• Use switch-case for menu selection.

3. Summary of Concepts Used
• Encapsulation: Private fields, public properties.
• Inheritance: Base and derived classes.
• Polymorphism: Virtual/override methods.
• Null values: Nullable properties.
• Class, Enum, Struct: All defined and used.
• Function: Methods for operations.
• Try-Catch, Parse, TryParse: Input handling.
